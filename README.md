Implementation of ElGamal and RSA algorithms with eavesdropping.

Alice: Sender
Bob: Receiver
Eve: Eavesdropper


THEORY

The ElGamal and  RSA are two algorithms for public key encryption.
1) Security of the RSA depends on the (presumed) difficulty of factoring large integers.
2) Security of the ElGamal algorithm depends on the (presumed) difficulty of computing discrete logs in a
large prime modulus.
